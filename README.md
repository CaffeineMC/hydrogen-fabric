Hydrogen is a free and open-source mod designed to reduce the game's memory requirements by implementing more
memory-efficient data structures and logic. It's primarily designed for more heavily modded scenarios, but can
offer (small) improvements even in lightly modded or vanilla scenarios.

The mod works on both the **client and server**, and **doesn't require the mod to be installed
on both sides**. However, the benefits of running Hydrogen on the server are pretty small as of the moment.

### Installation instructions

Hydrogen relies on the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). Users should select Fabric for either the Minecraft launcher (client) or
the dedicated server (server) depending on their needs.
Once you have installed Fabric, place the Hydrogen .jar in the `mods` folder generated by Fabric.

### Building from source

If you're hacking on the code or would like to compile a custom build of Hydrogen from the latest sources, you'll want
to start here.

#### Prerequisites

You will need to install JDK 8 in order to build Hydrogen. You can either install this through a package manager such as
[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) on Windows or [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) on other platforms. If you'd prefer to
not use a package manager, you can always grab the installers or packages directly from
[AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

On Windows, the Oracle JDK/JRE builds should be avoided where possible due to their poor quality. Always prefer using
the open-source builds from AdoptOpenJDK when possible.

#### Compiling

Navigate to the directory you've cloned this repository and launch a build with Gradle using `gradlew build` (Windows)
or `./gradlew build` (macOS/Linux). If you are not using the Gradle wrapper, simply replace `gradlew` with `gradle`
or the path to it.

The initial setup may take a few minutes. After Gradle has finished building everything, you can find the resulting
artifacts in `build/libs`.
